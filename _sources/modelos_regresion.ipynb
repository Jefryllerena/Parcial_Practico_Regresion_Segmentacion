Mejora en las Métricas con el Tamaño de la Ventana</strong></h3> <h4><strong>1.1.

Mejora en el Coeficiente de Determinación (R2)</strong></h4> <ul> <li><strong>R2:</strong> El coeficiente de determinación mejora con el tamaño de la ventana: <ul> <li>T=7: <code>6.235e-01</code> (R2=0.623)</li> <li>T=28: <code>7.231e-01</code> (R2=0.723)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <hr> <h3><strong>2. Mejor Ventana</strong></h3> <p>La ventana de tamaño <strong>T=28</strong> muestra los mejores resultados:</p> <ul> <li><strong>MAPE más bajo:</strong> <code>1.489e+08</code></li> <li><strong>MAE más bajo:</strong> <code>5.145e-01</code></li> <li><strong>RMSE más bajo:</strong> <code>6.918e-01</code></li> <li><strong>MSE más bajo:</strong> <code>4.786e-01</code></li> <li><strong>R2 más alto:</strong> <code>7.231e-01</code></li> </ul> <hr> <h3><strong>3. Observaciones</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>MAPE Elevado:</strong> Aunque mejora con ventanas más grandes, sigue siendo alto debido posiblemente a: <ul> <li>Relaciones no lineales no capturadas completamente.</li></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Autocorrelación en Residuos:</strong> El valor <code>LB_p=0.e+00</code> en todas las ventanas indica fuerte autocorrelación, reflejando que el modelo no captura bien la dinámica temporal.</li> <li><strong>Sobreajuste Potencial:</strong> La mejora al aumentar el tamaño de la ventana puede estar asociada a una mejor generalización del modelo ante más datos.</li> </ul> <hr> <h3><strong>4. Comparación con los anteriores Modelos</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>Modelo Lasso:</strong> El Árbol de Decisión supera ampliamente al Lasso, especialmente en R2.</li> <li><strong>Modelo Ridge:</strong> Mejor R2 en ventanas grandes comparado con Ridge.</li> <li><strong>Modelo KNN:</strong> Mejor R2 y menores errores en todas las ventanas.</li> <li><strong>Regresión Lineal:</strong> Supera ampliamente en R2 y errores a la Regresión Lineal.</li> </ul> <hr> <h3><strong>Conclusión</strong></h3> <p>El modelo de Árbol de Decisión muestra mejoras claras con ventanas más grandes, siendo <strong>T=28</strong> el mejor escenario. No obstante, los altos valores de MAPE y la autocorrelación en los residuos indican la necesidad de explorar métodos más robustos y complejos para mejorar el desempeño predictivo.</p> </div>"

Mejora en las Métricas con el Tamaño de la Ventana</strong></h3> <h4><strong>1.1. Reducción del Error</strong></h4> <ul> <li><strong>MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error):</strong> El MAPE disminuye gradualmente con el aumento del tamaño de la ventana: <ul> <li>T=7: <code>1.816e+08</code></li> <li>T=28: <code>1.514e+08</code> (reducción del 16.6%)</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>MAE (Mean Absolute Error):</strong> El error absoluto también disminuye con el aumento del tamaño de la ventana: <ul> <li>T=7: <code>5.088e-01</code></li> <li>T=28: <code>4.763e-01</code> (reducción del 6.3%)</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):</strong> El error cuadrático medio muestra una mejora constante: <ul> <li>T=7: <code>6.694e-01</code></li> <li>T=28: <code>6.280e-01</code> (reducción del 6.1%)</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>MSE (Mean Squared Error):</strong> El error cuadrático medio sigue una tendencia similar al RMSE: <ul> <li>T=7: <code>4.481e-01</code></li> <li>T=28: <code>3.944e-01</code> (reducción del 12.0%)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4><strong>1.2. Mejora en el Coeficiente de Determinación (R2)</strong></h4> <ul> <li><strong>R2:</strong> El coeficiente de determinación mejora con el tamaño de la ventana: <ul> <li>T=7: <code>7.405e-01</code> (R2=0.740)</li> <li>T=28: <code>7.718e-01</code> (R2=0.772)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <hr> <h3><strong>2. Mejor Ventana</strong></h3> <p>La mejor ventana para el modelo Random Forest es <strong>T=28</strong>, ya que presenta:</p> <ul> <li><strong>MAPE más bajo:</strong> <code>1.514e+08</code></li> <li><strong>MAE más bajo:</strong> <code>4.763e-01</code></li> <li><strong>RMSE más bajo:</strong> <code>6.280e-01</code></li> <li><strong>MSE más bajo:</strong> <code>3.944e-01</code></li> <li><strong>R2 más alto:</strong> <code>7.718e-01</code></li> </ul> <hr> <h3><strong>3. Observaciones</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>MAPE Elevado:</strong> Aunque mejora con ventanas más grandes, los valores siguen siendo muy altos debido a: <ul> <li>Escala de las variables o de la variable objetivo.</li> </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Autocorrelación en Residuos:</strong> El valor <code>LB_p=0.e+00</code> en todas las ventanas indica autocorrelación significativa, reflejando que el modelo no captura adecuadamente la dinámica temporal.</li> </li> </ul> <hr> <h3><strong>4. Comparación con los Otros Modelos</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>Modelo de Árbol de Decisión:</strong> Random Forest supera al Árbol de Decisión en todas las métricas, especialmente en R2.</li> <li><strong>Modelo Lasso:</strong> Random Forest ofrece un mejor rendimiento en MAPE, MAE, RMSE, MSE y R2.</li> <li><strong>Modelo KNN:</strong> Random Forest muestra un mejor R2 y menores errores (MAE, RMSE) en todas las ventanas.</li> <li><strong>Modelo Ridge:</strong> En ventanas pequeñas (T=7 y T=14), Random Forest tiene un mejor R2 y menores errores que Ridge.</li> </ul> <hr> <h3><strong>Conclusión</strong></h3> <p>El modelo Random Forest muestra un rendimiento mejorado con ventanas más grandes, alcanzando su mejor desempeño en <strong>T=28</strong>. Sin embargo, los valores elevados de MAPE y la autocorrelación en los residuos sugieren que se necesita un enfoque más robusto para manejar la complejidad de los datos. Se recomienda explorar modelos más complejos, ajustar hiperparámetros y añadir características temporales para mejorar las predicciones.</p> </div>"
